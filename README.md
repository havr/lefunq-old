### The Lefunq programming language

Lefunq is a general-purpose full-stack functional language. It's an impure, eager and statically typed language with Hindley-Milner type inference. Now it transpiles into JS, but multiple compilation targets are planned.

#### Status
In the middle of construction. Walk around carefully. Wear helmet. Beware of falling stacktraces.

#### Absent features

 - No obligatory academic stuff. One shouldn't need the category theory to write CRUDs or CLI utilities. 

 - No macro. The language itself should be flexible enough to satisfy all programmers needs.

 #### Features

 - Hindley-Milner'esque type inference

 - Curried-by-default functions.

 - Named and optional parameters.

 - [wip] Anonymous structs

 - [todo] Polymorphic variants

 - [todo] Algebraic types

 - [todo] Typeclasses

 - [todo] Syntactic sugar for monads
